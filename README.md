My personal software installation & configuration

## Disclaimer

This is a repository that I keep public in order to ease out the installation of my different computers.

The repository is not intended to be used as-is by many people, although special attention and care has been put in order to make it sensibly easy to be used by anyone wanting to try out this installation.

Although the goal for any non-contributor is to get inspiration, not to use it as you daily driver. Nothing can stop you from doing it so feel free to do so and open issues, but I can't guarantee to be available to fix issues.
